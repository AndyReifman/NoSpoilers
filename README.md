Extension that replaces the entire title of Youtube video with "No Spoilers!" so spoiler titles can be avoided. 

Open Source. Do what ever you want. 

To get the extension, download "NoSpoiler.crx", open Chrome and enter "chrome://extensions/" in the search bar (this should show all your current extensions), then drag "NoSpoilers.crx" into the chrome://extensions/ page. Confirm the permissions of the app and you're good to go. 

Default state is on, click the NS logo to turn the extension off and not block YouTube titles.
